## Tutorials : live Wikipedia processing using Streams on ICP4D
### Wiki submitted images extracted for facial and object model analysis
Processing phases :
- connect to SSE feed for realtime Wikipedia updates
- drop 'robot' updates
- extract updates pertaining to images
- Use model to locate faces
- Use model to locate images

Resulting in realtime categorization of content submitted to Wikiepedia,

** Missing Image **

In the example photo was submitted to Wikipeida, on which a 'Facial Recognizer' located face(s), the UI inscribed a bounding.

In the case that no faces were located the subsequent processing is skipped.


## Juypter Notebooks extracts - details

and results rendered in a notebook where this still was captured. Refer to 5  notebook for details.


### Getting started in ICP4D.
- Verify that you have 'Streams' add-on enabled. 
- Create a new 'Analytics project', from this Git repository. 
- Proceed to the imgAna_1 notebook to walk through composing, building and submitting a Streams application in ICP4D.
- Alternate: Jump to the end to whet your appetite,  run the imgAna_Finale notebook to see live streaming analysis of Wiki data.


### Notes
- Current migrated to less cluttered version. 
 - The imgAna* notebooks have be colidated into the wikiImageAnalysis notebook.
 - The videoImageAnalsys notebook focuses on driving the two models with images provided by Kafka, it is a subset of the wikiImageAnalysis processing.
 - The videoToAnalysis notebook pushes video images 
- Notebooks are functional on ICP4D and Cloud.

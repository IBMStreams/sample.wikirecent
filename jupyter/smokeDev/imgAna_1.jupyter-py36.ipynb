    "## Continious processing with Streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "[WikiRecentPhase0](imgAna_0.jupyter-py36.ipynb) illustrated accessing continious streams events from a notebook in Python as a way to explore the nature of the data and to understand how to develop it into useful insights. In that exploration data is collected, averages are calculated only as long as the notebook open and specific cells are running. That model makes it challenging to make business use of insights derived from the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will transition the work we did with the data in step 0 to a continuously running Streams job, develop the insights further and show how the Notebook can be used to access the outputs of the job for user visualization and action.\n",

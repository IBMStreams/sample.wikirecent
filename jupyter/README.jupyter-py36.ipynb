The initial notebook \ndemonstrates connecting to a datasource (Wikipedia), filtering updates and viewing the data in the browser. The\nfinal notebook applies multiple levels of AI models to locate, extract and score live updates from Wikipedia data.\n\nEach notebook composes, submits and renders the results as a standalone application. There are\nno code dependencies between notebooks. \n\n\n\n## Collection of links to Streams and ICP4D resources\n- [MediaWiki sse feed](https://stream.wikimedia.org/v2/stream/recentchange)\n- [MediaWiki explanation of feed](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Event_Platform/EventStreams)\n- [Invoking SPL operators](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.topology/doc/pythondoc/streamsx.spl.op.html#module-streamsx.spl.op)\n- [Topology](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.topology/doc/pythondoc/streamsx.topology.topology.html?highlight=window#streamsx.topology.topology.Topology)\n\n\n## imgAna_0\n- Access the wiki data using SSE directly in Python\n- Render update type (new, edit, update, log) counts in a graph\n\n## imgAna_1\n![stillPhase1](https://github.com/IBMStreams/sample.wikirecent/raw/master/jupyter/images/stillPhase1.jpg)\n- Access the wiki live data streams via SSE\n- Filter out messages that were generated by bots\n- View the live data in the notebook\n\n## imgAna_2 \n![stillPhase](https://github.com/IBMStreams/sample.wikirecent/raw/master/jupyter/images/stillPhase2.jpg)\n\nAccess the wiki data with the benefit of Streams. \n- Building on the previous notebook\n- Normalize the language of submission\n- Aggregate the top 10 submitters in the last 10 minutes: time-based windowing\n- Aggregate the top articles in the last 200 submissions: event-based windowing\n- View live data in notebook, top articles and languages in a \"dashboard\"\n\n## imgAna_3\n![stillPhase3](https://github.com/IBMStreams/sample.wikirecent/raw/master/jupyter/images/stillPhase3.jpg)\n- Building on the previous notebook\n- Analyze wiki updates to find image links\n- Shred pages using a Python package (beautifulsoup)  \n- View live data in notebook, render images submitted to Wikipedia\n\n## imgAna_4\n![stillPhase4](https://github.com/IBMStreams/sample.wikirecent/raw/master/jupyter/images/stillPhase4.jpg)\n- Building on the previous notebook\n- Run extracted images through the Facial Recognizer model and derive cropped facial image\n- Run cropped facial images through the Facial Emotion Classifier to generate a score\n- View live data in notebook, render submitted image, scored, cropped and classified by emotion\n\n# imgAnaFinale - 'cut to the cool'\nThis has the same output has imgAna_4 but with far fewer cells since the support code has been moved into the script directory.  The notebook \nfor the impatient: try it out, if this piques your curiosity go through the others. "
